📥 Share Import (Optional)

You can import existing BIP39 shares to reuse the same passphrase.
This allows multiple vaults to share the same underlying key material.

⚠️  SECURITY WARNING:
   Reusing shares across vaults means compromising one vault
   compromises ALL vaults using the same shares.

Import existing shares? (yes/no): 
[1/4] Generating 384-bit passphrase...
      ✓ Passphrase generated
[2/4] Splitting passphrase into 3 shares (threshold: 2)...
      ✓ 3 shares created using Shamir Secret Sharing
[3/4] Encoding shares as BIP39 mnemonics...
      ✓ 3 × 24-word mnemonics generated
[4/4] Generating RSA-4096 + Kyber-1024 keypair...
      ✓ Hybrid keypair generated and encrypted

📋 Secret Shares (2-of-3 threshold)

⚠️  CRITICAL: These shares are displayed ONCE and never stored!
    • Distribute to 3 different key holders
    • 2 shares required to decrypt messages
    • Each share is 24 words (BIP39 mnemonic)
    • Store securely: paper backup, password manager, or HSM

📝 Next Steps:
  1. Copy each share to a secure location (paper, password manager)
  2. Distribute shares to key holders via secure channels
  3. Test decryption immediately with K shares
  4. Add messages: will-encrypt encrypt --vault demo1.yaml --title '...'

✓ Setup complete. Vault ready for encryption.
